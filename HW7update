## What are your take aways with regard to web components?
### #Web components offer  reusable way to create and package UI elements for the web.It allows components to be independent and easily integrated into 
### different projects.This can enhance code organization, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.

## Are they here to stay? Is it the future? Is the future now? What would Brad say
### While web components provide modularity and encapsulation, other frameworks and libraries also play essential roles.They're only going to get better 
### and more complex.

## What are some additional ways to make web components that Brad mentions? Link to some examples that we aren't covering in class.
### Using a Compiler or Transpiler , or a  low-code or no-code platform that allows you to visually design and configure components without
### writing traditional code manually
